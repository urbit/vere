# Building Vere

We use [`bazel`][bazel][^1] to build Vere, which is packaged as a single binary,
`urbit`. We support the following `(host, target)` pairs, where the host platform
is where [`bazel`][bazel] runs and the target platform is where `urbit` will
run:

| Host Platform  | Target Platform |
|----------------|-----------------|
| `linux-aarch64`| `linux-aarch64` |
| `linux-x86_64` | `linux-x86_64`  |
| `macos-aarch64`| `macos-aarch64` |
| `macos-x86_64` | `macos-x86_64`  |

## Prerequisites

The first step is to install `bazel` using the instructions found on the [`bazel`][bazel-install][^1] site.

All platforms require the `automake` and `libtool` suite of tools installed in
order to build Vere. Before going any further, install them using your package
manager. For example, on macOS:

```console
brew install automake libtool
```

### Linux

After installing `automake` and `libtool`, you need to install the [musl libc] toolchain.  We use [musl libc][musl libc] instead of [glibc][glibc] on Linux, which enables us to generate statically linked binaries. As a prerequisite, you need to install the [musl libc][musl libc] toolchain appropriate for your target platform.

#### x86_64

To install the `x86_64-linux-musl-gcc` toolchain at
`/usr/local/x86_64-linux-musl-gcc`, run:
```console
bazel run //bazel/toolchain:x86_64-linux-musl-gcc
```

This will take a few minutes.

#### aarch64

To install the `aarch64-linux-musl-gcc` toolchain at
`/usr/local/aarch64-linux-musl-gcc`, run:
```console
bazel run //bazel/toolchain:aarch64-linux-musl-gcc
```

This will take a few minutes.

### macOS

After installing `automake` and `libtool`, you're ready to build Vere.

## Build Commands

Once you install the prerequisites, you're ready to build:
```console
bazel build :urbit
```

If you want a debug build, which changes the optimization level from `-O3` to
`-O0` and includes more debugging information, specify `dbg` as the
`compilation_mode`:
```console
bazel build --compilation_mode=dbg :urbit
```
Note that you cannot change the optimization level for third party
dependencies--those targets specified in `bazel/third_party`--from the command
line.

You can turn on CPU and memory debugging by specifying the `cpu_dbg` and/or the
`mem_dbg` build config.
```console
bazel build --config=cpu_dbg --config=mem_dbg :urbit
```

Note that ships booted from builds with one or both of these configs specified
are incompatible with builds of vere without them and vice versa.

If you need to specify arbitrary C compiler or linker options, use
[`--copt`][copt] or [`--linkopt`][linkopt], respectively:
```console
bazel build --copt='-Wall' :urbit
```

Note [`--copt`][copt] can be used to specify arbitrary C compiler
optimizations. They're passed directly to the compiler commands generated by
bazel.

Additionally, [`--copt`][copt] is propagated to _all dependencies_. This has the
undesirable side effect of considerably slowing down build times when you're
switching between different copts (say the inclusion or exclusion of some macro
define with `--copt='-DMACRO'`) since all dependencies will be rebuilt. If you
want only to pass the copt to the compiler commands invoked to build `:urbit`,
you can pass them with [`--per_file_copt`][per_file_copt] like so:

```console
bazel build --per_file_copt='pkg/.*@-DMACRO'
```

## Test Commands

You can build and run unit tests only on native builds. If you have a native
build and want to run all unit tests, run:
```console
bazel test --build_tests_only ...
```

If you want to run a specific test, say
[`pkg/noun/hashtable_tests.c`](pkg/noun/hashtable_tests.c), run:
```console
bazel test //pkg/noun:hashtable_tests
```

## Build Configuration File

Any options you specify at the command line can instead be specified in
`.user.bazelrc` if you find yourself using the same options over and over. This
file is not tracked by `git`, so whatever you add to it will not affect anyone
else. As an example, if you want to change the optimization level but don't want
type `--copt='-O0'` each time, you can do the following:
```console
echo "build --copt='-O0'" >> .user.bazelrc
bazel build :urbit
```

For more information on Bazel configuration files, consult the
[Bazel docs][bazel-config].

## Common Issues

If `bazel build` or `bazel test` generates an `undeclared inclusion(s) in rule`
error on macOS, the version of `clang` expected by the build system likely
doesn't match the version of `clang` installed on your system. To address this,
run `clang --version` and pass the version number via
`--clang_version="<version_string>"` to the failing command.
