# Urbit Runtime

[Urbit][urbit] is a personal server stack built from scratch. This repository
contains [Urbit's runtime environment][vere], the lowest layer of the Urbit
stack, which includes the Nock virtual machine, I/O drivers, event log, and
snapshotting system.

## Getting Started

For basic Urbit usage instructions, head over to [urbit.org][getting-started].

## Packages

Urbit's runtime is broken down into a few separate layers, each of which is
defined in its own package:

- [`pkg/c3`](pkg/c3): A set of basic utilities for writing Urbit's style of C.
- [`pkg/ent`](pkg/ent): A cross-platform wrapper for `getentropy(2)`.
- [`pkg/urcrypt`](pkg/urcrypt): A standardized interface for calling various
  cryptographic functions used in the Urbit runtime.
- [`pkg/ur`](pkg/ur): An implementation of [jam][jam] and [cue][cue], Urbit's
  bitwise noun serialization and deserialization algorithms, respectively.
- [`pkg/noun`](pkg/noun): The Nock virtual machine and snapshotting system.
- [`pkg/vere`](pkg/vere): The I/O drivers, event log, and main event loop.
