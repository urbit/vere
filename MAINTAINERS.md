# Maintaining

## Overview

We use a three-stage release pipeline. Each stage of the release pipeline has
its own dedicated branch and a corresponding "train" (also called a pace).
Features and bug fixes progress through each stage--and are subject to testing
along the way--until they're eventually released to the live network. This
pipeline automates our release process, making it much easier to quickly and
reliably ship code. It's also simple to reason about.

## Branches and Trains

The branches and their corresponding trains that comprise the stages of the
release pipeline are:

| Branch    | Train  | Target audience    |
|-----------|--------|--------------------|
| `develop` | `edge` | Runtime developers |
| `release` | `soon` | Early adopters     |
| `master`  | `live` | Everyone else      |

`develop` is the default branch in the repo, which means that all new pull
requests target it by default. The general flow of a new feature or bug fix
through the pipeline is:

```console
feature branch ----> develop ----> release ----> master
                        |             |             |
                    deployed to    deployed to   deployed to
                    edge train     soon train    live train
```

If an issue arises in the course of testing the `release` branch (because more
people are using `soon` than `edge`), a PR can be opened to target `release`.
If that's the case, the `master` needs to be merged back into `develop` after
`release` merges into `master` to ensure that `develop` gets the fix.

## Version Numbers

Each time a commit is pushed to `develop`, `release`, or `master`--say, when a
PR merges--we build and deploy a new version of the binary available for
consumption by anyone subscribed to that train (via `<pier>/.bin/pace`).

For `edge` and `soon`, each binary is given a version of the form
`{version number}-{shortened commit SHA}`, where `{version number}` is the
version number listed in the [version file in the root of this repo](./VERSION)
and `{shortened commit SHA}` is the shortened commit SHA of the commit the
binary was built from. This allows subscribers to `edge` and `soon` to
continually pull down new binaries via the `next` subcommand even when the
version number in the [version file](./VERSION) remains the same.

For `master`, each binary is given a version of the form `{version number}`,
where `{version number}` is simply the version number listed in the
[version file in the root of this repo](./VERSION).

Each time a release is cut (i.e. `develop` is merged into `release` to kick off
a release), the version number should be bumped on `develop` in anticipation of
the next release.

## Deploy Endpoints

Binaries are deployed to the following endpoints, where `{VN}` is the version
number in VERSION, `{CS}` is the shortened commit SHA of the commit the binary
is built off, and `{P}` is one of `linux-aarch64`, `linux-x86_64`,
`macos-aarch64`, and `macos-x86_64`:

- https://bootstrap.urbit.org/vere/edge/v{VN}-{CS}/vere-v{VN}-{P}
- https://bootstrap.urbit.org/vere/soon/v{VN}-{CS}/vere-v{VN}-{P}
- https://bootstrap.urbit.org/vere/live/v{VN}/vere-v{VN}-{P}

The most recently deployed version of a given train (pace) is uploaded to
https://bootstrap.urbit.org/vere/{T}/last, where `{T}` is one of `edge`, `soon`,
and `live`:

## Releases

In anticipation of a new release to `live`, create a new pull request
targeting `master` from `release`.

When you're ready to release to `live`, tag the tip of `release` with a tag of
the form `vere-v{version}`, where `{version}` is the contents of
[VERSION](./VERSION):
```console
$ cd path/to/vere/repo
$ git checkout release
$ git fetch origin && git merge origin/release
$ git tag vere-v$(cat VERSION)
$ git push origin vere-v$(cat VERSION)
```

Then merge the pull request, which triggers the deployment of the `live`
binaries. **Once the binaries have been deployed**, which usually takes about
thirty minutes, create a GitHub release using the following checklist:

- [ ] Select the just-created tag as the tag for the release.
- [ ] Select `master` as the target for the release.
- [ ] Use the tag name (i.e. `vere-v1.17`) as the title of the release.
- [ ] Select the prevoius release's tag (i.e. `vere-v1.16`) as the previous tag.
- [ ] Click "Generate release notes".
- [ ] Add the following information above the autogenerated `## What's Changed`
      section:
```text
Arvo {Kelvin version}K
Vere {Vere version}

## Description
{Notes describing the release}
```
- [ ] Upload a tarball of the binary to the release for each platform we
      support. Generate a platform's tarball using the following commands, where
      `{platform}` is one of `linux-aarch64`, `linux-x86_64`, `macos-aarch64`,
      and `macos-x86_64`:
```console
$ mkdir vere-v{version}-{platform}
$ wget -O vere-v{version}-{platform}/urbit https://bootstrap.urbit.org/vere/live/v{version}/vere-v{version}-{platform}
$ chmod +x vere-v{version}-{platform}/urbit
$ tar zcf {platform}.tgz vere-v{version}-{platform}
```
- [ ] Check the box marked "Set as the latest release".
- [ ] Click "Publish release".

Post an announcement to the [urbit-dev mailing
list][urbit-dev] containing a copy of the release notes. When in doubt, follow
the format of the previous release's announcement. Also post an announcement to
the "General" channel of the [Urbit Community group][urbit-community].
